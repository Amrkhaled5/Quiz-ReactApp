# Quiz-ReactApp
A simple quiz application built with React, designed to test knowledge about React concepts. The app tracks the user's score, shows the number of questions answered, and displays the final score.  

## Live Demo

- **context API Integration**: Leverages the Context API for managing and sharing state across components without prop drilling.
- **Quiz Questions**: Focused on React topics.  
- **Instant Feedback**: On each submission, the app indicates whether the answer is correct and shows the correct answer.  
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score and the number of questions answered.  
- **Final Results**: Shows a summary with the final score at the end of the quiz.  

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework.
- **contextAPI**: For global state management.
